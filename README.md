# Luminous

Luminous is an advanced lighting control software, created through a joint project within the Web Development and "Projekt Medienproduktionstechnik" courses at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences. Currently, it's employed in the studio of the University of Applied Sciences Cologne, located at the Deutz campus.

## Key Features

- **Scene Composition**: A sophisticated interface for designing complex lighting arrangements.
- **Granular Light Control**: Detailed customization options for individual light parameters including brightness, hue, and saturation.
- **Group Synchronization**: Coordinated control over groups of lights for seamless scene transitions.
- **Cross-Platform Utility**: Functional across various platforms, with a dedicated Electron app for PCs and a web-based interface for tablets.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integration with MotorMix hardware for a tactile and interactive user experience.
