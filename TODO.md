## Version 1.2.x TODOs

- [ ] Studio-Overview add Traverse Lights // master missing
  - [ ] Add info panels
- [ ] Prevent scene and solo overlaps
- [ ] Fader
  - [ ] More obvious fader highlighting
  - [ ] Rework spacing
  - [ ] Prevent rerendering on fader change
- [ ] LightFX
  - [ ] First light should be the current state
  - [ ] Second light should show a out of sync icon, if not the current state, and a button to sync
- [ ] Scenes
  - [x] Should be "on" when added
  - [ ] Visualisation of Scenes when specific fader is changed
  - [ ] If specific fader is changed, when scene is turned off, the fader should return to the value before the scene was turned on
- [ ] Setting to change the URL of the server

## Known Issues

- MotorMix
  - ~~Black-out button~~
  - Display bugs with page wheel
  - ~~Missing display light values~~
  - Displays only two pages until switched to Scenes and back
  - Faders sometimes jump randomly
  - Scenes do not turn off correctly, maybe backup value?
  - Reset button kills unsafed scenes
- Studio-Overview just uses ID, not universe // not sure if this is a problem or not
- Wrong devices displayed after changing number in LightSettings (Resolved?)
- Error if DMX channel exists multiple times
- Scenes do not fade in exact seconds and are subject to server performance
- RGB and bi-color picker mismatch from cursor position when window is resized
- Colors of the RGB lights are weird, when master is not at 100% - try in studio
