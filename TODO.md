## Known Issues

- MotorMix
  - ~~Black-out button~~
  - Display bugs with page wheel
  - ~~Missing display light values~~
  - Displays only two pages until switched to Scenes and back
  - Faders sometimes jump randomly
  - Scenes do not turn off correctly, maybe backup value?
  - Reset button kills unsafed scenes
- Studio-Overview just uses ID, not universe // not sure if this is a problem or not
- Wrong devices displayed after changing number in LightSettings (Resolved?)
- Error if DMX channel exists multiple times
- ~~Scenes do not fade in exact seconds and are subject to server performance~~
- MAYBE: Scenes only fade master? Check if this is a problem
- Colors of the RGB lights are weird, when master is not at 100% - try in studio
- LightFX
  - RGB and bi-color picker mismatch from cursor position when window is resized
  - Sync button wonky with multiple clients
  - Bi-color rounding down on page load
  - Bi-color resolution too low, no 50% possible
