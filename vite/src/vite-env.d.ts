/// <reference types="vite/client" />


/**
 * This is a TypeScript declaration file named 'vite-env.ts'. It is used to provide type definitions for 
 * the 'import.meta.env' object that is available in Vite applications. The 'import.meta.env' object provides 
 * access to environment variables and other runtime configuration options set during the build process.
 * 
 * The '/// <reference types="vite/client" />' directive at the top of the file is a reference to the type 
 * definitions for the 'vite/client' package. This allows the TypeScript compiler to properly recognize the 
 * types used in the 'import.meta.env' object, enabling better type-checking and auto-completion in the codebase
